# preview-server

A docker container to produce PNG image previews for common file types. This container is intended to be used as part of a larger application stack.

The container uses circusd to execute and monitor a Python async http server that is the main service as well as soffice.bin (run via unoconv) which is used for office document conversion. The preview service also utilizes `ffmpeg`, `ghostscript` and `imagemagick`.

The focus of this project is to provide a preview success rate as close as possible to 100%. This is achieved by careful testing and error handling. For example, `soffice.bin` will be restarted if it consumes too much memory. Also, the preview service will retry requests to `soffice.bin` in order to recover from conversion errors.

## Usage

This service is intended for use exclusively as a docker container. While it may be possible to run this application stand-alone, this is not recommended. For normal usage, you should pull the latest stable image off DockerHub and run it like this:

```shell
docker pull btimby/preview-server
docker run -p 3000:3000 --tmpfs /tmp -ti btimby/preview-server
```

Once the service has initialised, files, paths, or urls can be sent to the `/preview/` endpoint, and a PNG preview will be returned. Optional `width` and `height` arguments can be sent with the request to control the size of the returned preview image.

```shell
curl -o out.png -F 'file=@mydoc.doc' http://localhost:3000/preview
curl -o out.png -F 'url=http://somedomain.com/some-pdf' http://localhost:3000/preview
```

## Options

A number of features are controlled by environment variables.

`PREVIEW_FILES` - This option informs the preview service where files are located. When enabled, the service can be sent a path rather than a file body. The provided path is used relative to `PREVIEW_FILES`.

For example, below the file located at `/mnt/files/path/to/file.doc` will be previewed.

```shell
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 --tmpfs /tmp \
    -v /mnt/files:/mnt/files -e PREVIEW_FILES=/mnt/files \
    btimby/preview-server
curl -o out.png -F 'path=/path/to/file.doc' \
    -F 'width=200' -F 'height=100' http://localhost:3000/preview/
```

`PREVIEW_STORE` - By default generated previews are ephemeral. If you wish to store the previews so that they are not regenerated in future requests, you can do so using ththis option.

This can be used as a cache mechanism, for example by using tmpfs. Optionally, you can provide a file system (even a shared file system) for long-term storage. When combined with `PREVIEW_FILES`, The file's mtime is compared to the preview's mtime. If the source file is newer, the preview is regenerated. This option has no effect for POSTed or downloaded files.

For example, below the host's `/mnt/store` directory or device will be used to store generated previews. The second call to `curl` will be much faster as it will simply return the preview generated in the first call.

```shell
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 --tmpfs /tmp \
    -v /mnt/files:/mnt/files -e PREVIEW_FILES=/mnt/files \
    -v /mnt/store:/mnt/store -e PREVIEW_STORE=/mnt/store \
    btimby/preview-server
curl -o out.png -F 'path=/path/to/file.doc' http://localhost:3000/preview/
curl -o out.png -F 'path=/path/to/file.doc' http://localhost:3000/preview/
```

`PREVIEW_STORE_MAX_SIZE` & `PREVIEW_STORE_CLEANUP_INTERVAL` - If you utilize durable storage for previews, you can also control how much space is used with these options.

For example, below the storage location will be pruned down to 10G every 15 minutes.

```shell
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 --tmpfs /tmp \
    -v /mnt/files:/mnt/files -e PREVIEW_FILES=/mnt/files \
    -v /mnt/store:/mnt/store -e PREVIEW_STORE=/mnt/store \
    -e PREVIEW_STORE_MAX_SIZE=10G -e PREVIEW_STORE_CLEANUP_INTERVAL=15 \
    btimby/preview-server
```

`PREVIEW_WIDTH` & `PREVIEW_HEIGHT` - These options provide the default width and height of generated PNG previews. If the caller omits `width` and `height` parameters to the service, these defaults are used.

`PREVIEW_MAX_WIDTH` & `PREVIEW_MAX_HEIGHT` - These options provide the maximum allowable `width` and `height` that a user can request.

`PREVIEW_LOGLEVEL` & `PREVIEW_HTTP_LOGLEVEL` - These options control the log output generated by the preview service. The first applies to the service in general, the second to `aiohttp`'s access log.

While developing, you might increase `PREVIEW_LOGLEVEL` to see details about the service operation, but lower `PREVIEW_HTTP_LOGLEVEL`. During normal operation, the opposite may be more useful.

## Development

To build, run:

```shell
docker build --rm -ti btimby/preview-server .
```

Once the service is initialized, you can test it using:

To run the stress testing tool `make test`

To use the interactive test: `make test.html`
